## 🎯 Objectives

- How are projects coming along? 👀
- Review Login and add Logout
- Client-side routing with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- Organizing your files

## 🏗️ Project

You should have detailed wireframes and a user flow outline, and components for at least the initial "page" your user is going to see when they arrive at your site. By today, you should be able to make GET requests for questions and their answers (if you are working on Questionbox) or for cards and friends (if you are working on Social Cards).

🚀 Deploy to Netlify today if you haven't already!

### 🗄️ Organizing your files

When you have one component per file (which is how it usually should be), the files can accumulate very quickly. This is _very_ subjective, but there are strategies and organizational patterns that you can follow to structure your files in a React application. You should always follow the practices and conventions established by the team that you work with.

For starters, here are two good takes on how to organize your files.
