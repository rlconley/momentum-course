## 🎯 Objectives

- Understanding what "logged in" means in code
- Implementing token authentication in a React application
- Using local storage with state to store an auth token
- Building a log-in form
- Making POST requests with Axios

## 🏗️ Collaborative Project

Work with your team to get some initial components rendering. You can render components individually just to get them showing up on the page, without completing the conditions to show them or the interaction between them yet!

### Goals by the next meeting

- Your app can make GET requests for questions and answers OR cards and friends.
- Show questions or cards on the page.
- Have at least a solid start on POST requests for creating questions or cards.
- Deploy to Netlify as soon as possible.
    - PRO TIP ⭐ Your code needs to run locally with no errors before you can deploy it.
