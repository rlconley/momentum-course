## 🎯 Objectives

- Review first impressions of React
- Build a small React app together
- Components and JSX
- Handling data in React with props and state

## 🏗️ Project: Freeshelf | Slideshow

Today, you'll start on your first React app without a tutorial. This is **due on {{ site.data.projects.react_freeshelf.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}**.

[React Freeshelf]({{ site.data.projects.react_freeshelf.url }})

This should be challenging for a React beginner, but if you finish it early, please do this additional project:

[React Slideshow]({{ site.data.projects.react_slideshow.url }})

🧰 Please be sure to install AND USE the [React Developer Tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).
