## Objectives

- Return to JavaScript!
- The modern JavaScript ecosystem
- ES6 features

## 📖 Read | 📺 Watch | 🎧 Listen

_These are required readings, videos, and/or podcasts. Read, watch, or listen, and **take notes**._

- ⭐ 📖 [Modern JavaScript Explained for Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70) -> This is essential for context.
- 📖 [State of JS 2022 Survey Results](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/) Skim for an overview of current trends in the JS ecosystem.
- 📺 [ES6 tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQc7RUAg18)
- 📺 [Modern JavaScript for Django Developers](https://2021.djangocon.us/talks/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/)
- 📖 [Modern JavaScript for Django Developers](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/) - this is the blog post version of the above talk. **Read the first two parts only**:
    - [Part 1: Organizing your Front-End Codebase in a Django Project](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/client-server-architectures/)
    - ⭐[Part 2: A Crash Course in Modern JavaScript Tooling](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/javascript-tooling/)

## 🎯 To Do

1. Review the code in [JavaScript You Need to Know for React]({{ site.team_notes_repo}}/blob/main/js-for-react.md). You'll need to be able to read and use the JS in these notes to work with React effectively. **It would be valuable practice to type out the examples and run them yourself.**

2. Complete **at least three exercises** from this list on [Exercism.io JavaScript Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript). You're encouraged to work together!

- Isogram
- Scrabble Score
- ETL
- Simple Cipher
- Hamming
- Gigasecond
- Grade School

**Read the tests** provided with each exercise by clicking on the Tests tab in the editor (or opening the test file if you are using the CLI). The tests will show you _exactly_ how the function you're supposed to write will be called and with what arguments.

💫 **PRO TIPS**

- **If your exercises are locked** you need to switch from Learning Mode to Practice Mode. [Here's a short video showing you how to do that.](https://www.loom.com/share/ad7209af2267427889c98699f0694d11)
- When you run the tests, only focus on ONE test at a time. Write code that will get that test -- and ONLY that test -- passing. Then, when you have one passing test, look at the next failing test. Again, just that one! Write code to pass this test. This may require you to _rewrite_ the code you just wrote to pass the first test. That's ok. Writing code like this is called Test-Driven Development (TDD) and it's a useful skill to practice. **One test at a time, try to keep previously tests passing, read the test results each time _carefully_, and _be patient_.**
- If you get through two, keep going! More practice is better.

**Please come to the front-end team meeting with either/both of the following**:

- a solution you got working
- a question about something that blocked your progress
