## 🎯 Objectives

- Exercism review
- Intro to React
    - How does React work?
    - What does React code look like?

## ✅ To Do

- Continue working on Exercism. I'll take requests for one to work through together when we meet.
- Need some JS review? Create a list of topics that you would like us to dig into some more. I'll take requests for demos if you want to review anything from Phase 1 or in the notes on JS for React.
- Required reading/watching/listening for today or anything from yesterday that you didn't get to.
- Work on the React tutorial project(s) below.

## 🛠️ Setup

Make sure you have the following set up in your local environment.

- [Node & `npm`][npm]
- [ESLint for VS Code][eslint]
- [React developer tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

## 📖 Read | 📺 Watch | 🎧 Listen

- ⭐ 📖 [React Quick Start (beta docs)](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn) These docs are still being written, so they are incomplete, but what is written is much more helpful than the older offical docs.
- 📖 [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- 📺 [Kent C. Dodds, The Introduction to React You've Been Missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAIdyBFHfVU)

## 🏗️ Project: React Tutorial

[Ali Spittel's Beginner's Guide to React Tutorial](https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/). This is a really friendly tutorial for total beginners that will show you the most modern way to build React apps.

[This link will create an empty repo on GitHub that you can use to push your tutorial code to]({{ site.data.projects.react_beginner_tutorial.url }}).

If you finish this and want to keep going, try one of these other tutorials:

- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) - video-driven, intense and very complete
- [The official (beta) React tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) - classic, official.
- [Dave Ceddia's React tutorial](https://daveceddia.com/react-getting-started-tutorial/) - very long, very comprehensive, but still pretty accessible
