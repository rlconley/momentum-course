Your goal in this phase is to design and build a real-world software product, working collaboratively on a small team using agile development practices and all the tools you've learned so far, and some you will learn as you go.

**The people skills you'll use will be just as important as the technical skills -- perhaps more so.**

The experience of working on a team during this phase and the product you build will form the foundation for your job search.

**You will not begin writing code for your project until all the planning is done.**
