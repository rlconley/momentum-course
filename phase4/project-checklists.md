## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Your First Sprint

Today should be used for finalizing planning and doing research on data, technology, and tools you might need.

The following checklists will help you get ready to start writing code.

### ‚úÖ Checklist for the whole team, before you write code

- Every team member is clear on your MVP, and you know _exactly_ what you are building.
- You have added user stories and tasks (at minimum, for MVP) to your Trello board _Backlog_, and you have first tasks queued in _Current Sprint_.
- You have [created a team organization on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) and added every team member.
- You have created your project repo or repos on GitHub and made sure everyone is added as a collaborator.
    - Make sure you have a `.gitignore` file! You can get one that is specific to your project at [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore). Even more handy: use this [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore).
- Everyone is clear on the Git and GitHub workflow your team will follow.
- **Consider appointing a team lead** who can be responsible for running meetings, leading at check-in, and looking after the Trello board. Even better: rotate this role to share the responsibility.

### ‚úÖ Back-end Checklist

- **Models!** How will you represent the _nouns_ your project needs?
    - What fields belong on those models? Use the [Django Model Field Reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/).
    - What relationships exist between the models? (one-to-many, many-to-many?)
        - Consider using [the CRC model](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/crcModel.htm) to help guide your discussions.
        - You should create an ER (entity relationship) diagram for your models to map relationships. This may change as you work, but you should have thought through and documented your plan to start with.
- What data will the front end rely on the back end for?
- What endpoints will you need to deliver that data?
    - Are you returning HTML? What templates does the front end need, and who will make those?
    - Are you returning JSON? How will you structure your data?
- üö® Make sure you are using `django-environ` and a `.env` file. This will be especially important for secret keys and sensitive info, like AWS credentials. **DON'T COMMIT YOUR SECRET KEYS!**
- Make sure you are using Postgres and not SQLite.
- Deploy early.
    - Make sure more than one person on your team has access to the dashboard on Render.
    - Make sure that you keep an eye on your production app! Every time you merge a pull request and the main branch changes, it will trigger a new deploy, so you should check and test your app to confirm that your newest code is working in production.
- Put documentation in place early and make sure your front end has access to it.

### ‚úÖ Front-end Checklist

- Have you mapped out a user flow through your app?
- **Wireframes for each interface the user will see**
    - What URL corresponds to each page or interface the user sees? (with or without React Router)
    - What data will you need on each page or interface? Where is it coming from?
    - What requests will you need to make from the front end?
- Are you making forms? Discuss data with the backend.
- What assets (e.g. images, logos) will you need?
- General strategy for CSS and design so that you can budget time for it.
    - Are you using a CSS library (e.g. Material UI, Bulma)? What is the general look and feel of your app?
    - Start to think about UI/UX and design
- Deploy early.
    - Make sure that more than one person on your team has access to the Netlify dashboard for your app ([Netlify docs on adding site members](https://docs.netlify.com/accounts-and-billing/team-management/manage-team-members/#manage-site-members)).
    - Keep an eye on the production app!
    - Every time you merge a pull request and the main branch changes, it will trigger a new deploy, so you should check and test your app to confirm that your newest code is working in production.
