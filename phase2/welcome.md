Welcome to Phase 2, where we'll be learning about back end development. Topics we'll cover include:

- Python and object-oriented programming
- Building web applications with Django
- Working with a relational database

## Objectives

- Running Python
- Syntax differences between JS and Python
- Python
  - variables
  - `if` statements
  - `while` loops
  - Input and output with `input` and `print`
  - Functions

## ✅ TODO today

1. [Make sure your dev environment is set up, using our guide](https://momentumlearn.notion.site/Setting-up-your-Python-Development-Environment-91c5006b5a504844ad4e6abf5d209928).
2. Read [Python VS JavaScript – What are the Key Differences Between The Two Popular Programming Languages?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-vs-javascript-what-are-the-key-differences-between-the-two-popular-programming-languages/)

## 🎯 Project

We'll be using the Thinkific content as an introduction to Python concepts. Please complete the [Python section](https://momentumlearn.thinkific.com/courses/take/back-end-development-with-python-and-django/) through while statements by Tuesday Morning, 10/31.
