## üéØ Project: Django Flashcards

For this project you will work in pairs using pair progamming techniques. You will work in a shared repo and **submit one application** that your duo will build together. 

The first thing you should do is to Then, the very next thing you should do is determine what **models** you will need and what attributes and relationships they should have. An ER diagram can be very helpful here.

üëâ [Django flashcards project repo]({{ site.data.phase2.projects.django_flashcards.url }})

This is **due on {{ site.data.phase2.projects.django_flashcards.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}**.

### Dev Teams

For this project, **the first team member listed should accept the assignment** and enter the name of your team.

After that step, the other team members can then accept the assignment and join their team.

- Team Bubbles: Jose, Jon
- Team Buttercup: Jordan, Maria
- Team Blossom: Kelsey, Freddie


### ‚úÖ Project Checklist

- Set up a new Django project from scratch. There is no starter code in the assignment repo.
- Make sure to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files (like your `.env` file and `db.sqlite3`) from Git. You can get one specific to a Django project at [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore). Just search for `Django` and copy and paste the text you find there into your `.gitignore` file. It should be placed at the root of your repo.
- Make sure to create a custom user model, following best practices. **Do this before you run any migrations.** [This guide may be helpful to you.](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)
- You may want to install `django-debug-toolbar`, `django-extensions`, and `django-environ`, as we have done in previous projects.
