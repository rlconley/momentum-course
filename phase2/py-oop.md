Today, we'll take a brief survey of classes and objects in Python to get us ready to take on Django.

## Today's topics

- Python Classes
  - Instantiating an Object
  - Attributes
  - Instance Methods
  - "Magic" Methods


## üéØ Project

During the first part of this week, we will be applying principles of Object Oriented Programming in Python to build a Blackjack card game. We will work on this together in class.

- [Inheritance and Composition in Python OO](https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/)
- [OO-Programming](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html) -- _This is a chapter from a book called **Beyond the Basic Stuff With Python** by Al Sweigart. He has written a ton of great books on Python and makes them available to read for free online at [inventwithpython.com](https://inventwithpython.com/). You might check out [**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). It's a fantastic beginner book._

### Classes in Python
