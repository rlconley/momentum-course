## Objectives

- Practice/Review JS Concepts

## ðŸŽ¬ End of Phase Technical Presentations

The presentations at the end of this phase will be in the form of a short presentation. Each of you will present on one of the projects you did in Phase 1. The presentation should be **4-5 minutes long**, and no longer. For this first phase, your presentation can be in English or Spanish.

**Your target audience is a brand new Momentum student who is just at the beginning of Phase 1 after Foundations.** Imagine you are teaching them how to do what you've done in this project. Give them the benefit of your experience over these past several weeks.

**This presentation does not have to be polished, scripted, or edited.** But your audience should be able to follow what you're saying and understand the points you are making. You should illustrate the concepts you are talking about with examples from your code.

**Suggestions for how to use your time.**
~ 1 min - show the project in the browser and highlight its functions
~ 3 min - pick a couple of elements of the code that you want to explain line by line and show what you learned in the process
~ 1 min - a challenge you encountered in the project and how you got through it

**Your presentations will be at 2pm, this Thursday, Oct 26.**

## âœ… Requirements for passing the phase
