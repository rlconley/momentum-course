## ðŸ’» Today's Project: Git It

Complete [Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron), a tutorial program that will walk you through the basics of Git and GitHub.

To install it, `cd` into the directory where you will keep your Momentum work and run this command: `git clone https://github.com/momentumlearn/git-it-electron.git` This will create a new directory called git-it-electron. cd into this new directory and run the following commands one at a time: 
`npm install`
`npm start` 
This should open up the Git-It application on your desktop, and you can follow the instructions inside the application from here in order to complete it.

Once the application is running, read the instructions and complete the tasks in Git-it. Completion of the project is the link to the pull request that you will make in the second-to-last Git-It task.

Your link should look similar to this, with a different number at the end: `https://github.com/jlord/patchwork/pull/37062`

[Submit the link to your pull request url using this form](https://forms.gle/hKL37abHZ7TEoyWT6).
