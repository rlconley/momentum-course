## Return to JS

- [MDN: A Re-Introduction to JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) -> This is a solid and comprehensive reference with topics clearly labeled.
- [Clean Code: JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) -> "Clean Code" is a concept popularized by a book of the same name by Robert C. Martin. It means code that is easy to understand and easy to change. This guide applies these concepts to show you how to write clear and maintainable JavaScript. This is something that you will pick up as you go along, so don't worry about "following the rules." The rules are subjective and open to interpretation (as this guide shows). But it's good to know that standards for code exist and developers are commonly expected to conform to them.
