## CSS Libraries

We care about the look and feel of the UI, but that doesn't always mean we have to write custom CSS. Sometimes (like now when you focusing on learning other things!) it makes sense to rely on a library for most or all of your styling. There are a range of libraries from the very comprehensive to the very minimal. Here are some lighter-weight ones that you could check out:

- [SmolCSS - minimal snippets](https://smolcss.dev/) You can just copy and paste these styles as needed. ðŸ˜Ž
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
