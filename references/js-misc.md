## Working with Dates

- [MDN: JS Date Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - This is a very commonly used library for working with dates in JS. It's big and kind of old, but handy for reformatting how dates are displayed. You could also check out modern alternatives:
    - [day.js](https://day.js.org/)
    - [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/)
    - [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)
- [Blog post: Understanding Date and Time in JS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-date-and-time-in-javascript )

## Utilities

- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - This is a JS utility library -- lots of handy little functions that can make it easier to do common things
