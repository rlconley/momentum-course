## Interacting with the DOM

## Events

- [MDN Introduction to Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)
- [MDN Element Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#events) -> this is where you can see the events that are defined for elements (like "click" or "mouseover")
- [MDN Event Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) -> this is a huge list of all the available events, useful mainly to get an idea of what's possible

## Extra: Events

This is a good explanation about how JS events "bubble" up the chain of elements on the page:

- [JS Event Bubbling and Capturing](https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing)

If you would like to know more about the JavaScript Event Loop and how it works, I highly recommend this resource. Don't miss the video of the conference talk that goes along with it -- it's excellent:

## Extra: Browser Rendering

Here is more info about what is happening when a browser renders a page -- very enlightening, although not strictly necessary at this stage.

- [About the browser rendering engine](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#The_rendering_engine)
- [How browser rendering works](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-the-scenes-6782b0e8fb10/)

## Extra: DOM Structure

This resource is really not at all necessary to understand or work with the DOM, _but_ if you want to know more about the concept of tree structures (like the DOM!) in computer science, check out this piece from [Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series](https://medium.com/basecs). She is awesome! There is also a thoroughly delightful accompanying [BaseCS podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) with the equally amazing Saron Yitbarek.
