## Intro to REST APIs

- [Notes: REST APIs 101]({{ site.team_notes_repo }}/blob/main/rest.md)
- [RESTful APIs](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) _Read up through the "Standard Methods" subsection of the section on "Methods". You can read more if you want to but it gets pretty deep._
- [Safia Abdullah, You and Me Learn All About HTTP](https://dev.to/captainsafia/you-and-me-learn-all-about-http-with-safia-abdalla-3nd0)
- [Web APIs Explained By Selling Goods From Your Farm](https://blog.codeanalogies.com/2018/02/27/web-apis-explained-by-selling-goods-from-your-farm/)

## REST API Design

- [Overview of creating an API](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2019/02/01/creating-api-endpoint-django-rest-framework/) _Nothing much new in this article, but it is a good summary and high-level overview of how to go about creating an API with DRF._

## Views

### Class-based Views

- [Class-based vs. function-based views](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/article/2017/03/21/class-based-views-vs-function-based-views.html) _This is about Django views in general, not specific to DRF._
- [DRF Docs: Class-based views](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/) _This talks about `APIView`_.

### Generic Views

- [DjangoCon 2019: Generic View? What Is That and Why Would I Use It?, Felipe Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmKowZNmkCo) _Again about class-based views in Django but the explanation is relevant to what you will see in DRF._
