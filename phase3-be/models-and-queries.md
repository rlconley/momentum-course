## 🎯 Objectives

- Designing your models
- Deploying a Django app
- Managers, lookups, and querysets
- Using the Django shell to test out your models and make queries

## 🏗️ Project: Building Habit Tracker

Today your models should be done, so you can begin building out the urls, views, and templates you will need. Before you write the code, plan for what you will need. A good way to do this is to sketch out what your user will see.

There are examples for a lot of what you need to do in the Django Recipes codebase but you will have to adapt them to your Habit Tracker use cases.
